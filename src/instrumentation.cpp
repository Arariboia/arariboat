/* 
The ADS1115 is a Delta-sigma (ΔΣ) ADC, based on the principle of
oversampling. The input signal of a ΔΣ ADC is sampled at a high
frequency (modulator frequency) and subsequently filtered and
decimated in the digital domain to yield a conversion result at the
respective output data rate.

The ratio between modulator frequency and output data rate is called
oversampling ratio (OSR). By increasing the OSR, and thus reducing the
output data rate, the noise performance of the ADC can be optimized.
In other words, the input-referred noise drops when reducing the output
data rate because more samples of the internal modulator are averaged
to yield one conversion result. Increasing the gain, therefore reducing
the input voltage range, also reduces the input-referred noise, which
is particularly useful when measuring low-level signals.

The use of the ADS1115 as an external ADC was chosen to obtain higher
resolution and linearity, as well as programmable gain to avoid the
need for instrumentation amplifiers. The ADS1115 has 4 addresses, which
are determined by the state of the ADDR pin. Our board has a solder
bridge / jumper that allows selection between addresses. The ADS1115 is
connected to the ESP32 via I2C. The ESP32 is the master and the ADS1115
is the slave. Make sure that the ADS1115 is connected to the ESP32 via
I2C and that it is set to a correct address.

A common ground is also required between the ESP32 and the ADS1115,
which is given when the ESP32 is powered by the same battery as the
ADS1115, but not when the ESP32 is powered by the USB port during tests
on the laboratory workbench. In this case, the ground of the ESP32 and
the ADS1115 must be explicitly connected together for the I2C
communication to work. If the ADS1115 is not detected, check continuity
of the wires with a multimeter.
